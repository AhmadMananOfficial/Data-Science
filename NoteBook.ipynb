    "\n",
    "The typical **Data Science workflow** includes these major stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Problem Formulation 📝 \n",
    "- The first task is defining the problem you want to solve.  \n",
    "> *Example: Predicting house prices — You will determine the inputs (features) and the desired outputs (predictions).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Data Acquisition 📥  \n",
    "- Once the problem is defined, the next step is gathering the relevant data. This involves identifying data sources and acquiring the necessary datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Data Preparation 🧹 \n",
    "- After acquiring data, it must be cleaned and pre-processed. This step ensures that the data is in a usable format for analysis. \n",
    "> 🧼 Remove duplicates, handle missing values, encode categories, normalize values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Data Analysis 🕵️‍♂️ \n",
    "- At this stage, models are build, evaluated, and fine-tuned to solve the problem by using **statistics** and **machine learning** techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ Model Deployment  🚀\n",
    "- Once the model is ready, it is deployed to generate real-world insights. This may involve putting the model into production for use by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ Presenting Insights  📊\n",
    "- After generating insights from the model, Use visualizations and storytelling to explain results to **non-technical** audiences like managers and executives.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📊 Tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Tableau**, or **Power BI** can help make results clear and impactful.\n",
